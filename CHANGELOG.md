# Changelog

All notable changes to Pixa Agent are documented here.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-07-28

### Added
- Thinking-effort picker (Low/Medium/High) for models that support it. Appears
  next to the model dropdown only when the selected model declares support, and
  resets on model switch. Custom providers can opt in with
  `supportsReasoningEffort: true` in `pixa.providers`.
- "Reject all" for staged changes, alongside the existing "Apply all"
- Recovery for tool calls that some local-model runtimes return as text instead
  of the native `tool_calls` field, so smaller local coding models can run agent
  tasks. Only calls naming a real registered tool are executed.

### Fixed
- Thinking-effort picker never appeared, and selecting a level did nothing —
  the capability flag wasn't included in the payload sent to the panel and the
  selection handler was missing. Added a compile-time exhaustiveness check on
  the message handler so an unhandled message is now a build error.
- Effort was silently dropped for custom providers even when explicitly enabled,
  making the picker a dead control on non-OpenRouter endpoints
- Plan checklist never rendered for most models — the parser expected a numbered
  list but the prompt didn't ask for one
- Reviewing a change before applying it was easy to miss; the proposed file name
  is now clickable and opens the diff directly

## [0.6.1] — 2026-07-23

### Added
- In-panel Providers UI: add/delete providers, quick-setup presets (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, NVIDIA NIM, OpenRouter), and live model discovery via `/models`
- Command-safety policy: known-destructive commands are blocked before execution, on top of the existing per-command approval gate
- Recovery for tool calls some local-model runtimes return as text instead of the native `tool_calls` field, so smaller local coding models can run agent tasks
- Reasoning-effort picker for models that support it (OpenRouter's `reasoning: { effort }`)
- "Reject all" for staged changes, alongside the existing "Apply all"

### Fixed
- Extension failing to activate after packaging (a dependency wasn't bundled into the `.vsix`)
- Plan checklist not rendering for most models (parser expected a numbered list; the prompt didn't ask for one)
- Diff review being easy to miss — the proposed-file name is now clickable and opens the diff directly
